# Find Banks
This project pulls data from publicapi.dev. I am implementing a bank data API that returns the banks in a user's country by collecting their two-letter (ISO2-3166) country code.

Requirements.
1. Your unique API key
2. Your country code (NG, US, PE, AG...)
3. A keyboard 😉

The code run is pretty simple. 
Click on the button and enter your country code; check the browser console for a list of banks that exist in your country.
